# Orange-Anomaly-Detection-CNN

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to detect surface anomalies in oranges through image classification.  
This project aims to support automated quality control in fruit inspection systems by distinguishing between normal and defective oranges.

---

## Overview

The dataset consists of orange images categorized into **normal** and **anomalous** classes.  
The model was trained and validated to recognize imperfections such as texture irregularities, color deviations, or visible damage on the fruitâ€™s surface.

The CNN architecture was optimized using different activation functions (ReLU, Tanh, etc.) to compare accuracy and validation loss across configurations.
